# wahisclient

This package serves as a client interface for accessing the REPEL project
database from R.  It is intended for use within the REPEL project for data
analysis and model-building, and for extended use for projects that can use
the REPEL database of WAHIS and other data.  It is currently EHA-only, but
may be used a public package for database access.

Currently the package only operates in a local database-cloning mode, similar
to other such packages (`citesdb`, `eidith`, `taxadb`).  It requires access
to EHA AWS S3 buckets to work, using the `aws.signature` package.

In the future it will also contain functions for querying the live project
Postgres database and possibly common workflows and visualization functions.
